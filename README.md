# 🏒 Hockey Schedule API

A small FastAPI microservice that fetches hockey schedules from **stats.swehockey.se**, parses the raw HTML, and exposes a clean JSON API for a specific team.
Designed for dashboards like **Glance**, home-lab widgets, or automation setups.

The API supports **any team**, based on a configurable substring (e.g., `"modo"`, `"aik"`, `"björklöven"`).
No code changes are required — everything is configured via environment variables.

---

## ✨ Features

* Fetches & parses games from a Swehockey schedule URL
* Supports *any* team through a simple environment variable (`TEAM_TAG`)
* Returns both **last played game** and **next upcoming game**
* Automatically fetches **team badges/logos** from TheSportsDB
* Computes match result from your team’s perspective:

  * `"win"`, `"loss"`, `"draw"`
* Lightweight, fast, cache-friendly
* Perfect for use with **Glance dashboards**, Home Assistant, or custom UIs
* Stateless → easy to deploy in Docker, Kubernetes, or k3s

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

Run the API for MoDo Hockey:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e TEAM_TAG="modo" \
  -e SCHEDULE_URL="https://stats.swehockey.se/ScheduleAndResults/Schedule/18266" \
  -e THESPORTSDB_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" \
  hockey-api:latest
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000/team
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

The service is configured entirely with environment variables:

| Variable              | Required | Description                                            | Example                      |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `TEAM_TAG`            | Yes      | Substring used to identify the team (case-insensitive) | `modo`, `aik`, `björklöven`  |
| `SCHEDULE_URL`        | Yes      | Swehockey schedule URL for your league/season          | `https://.../Schedule/18266` |
| `THESPORTSDB_API_KEY` | Optional | API key for badge/logo fetching                        | `123` (free tier)            |

### How TEAM_TAG works

The API matches all games where `TEAM_TAG` appears in either team name.
Examples:

| TEAM_TAG | Matches                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `modo`   | “MoDo Hockey”, “MODO Hockey Dam” |
| `löven`  | “IF Björklöven”                  |
| `aik`    | “AIK”, “AIK Hockey”              |

## 📦 Docker Compose Example

```yaml
services:
  hockey-api:
    image: hockey-api:latest
    environment:
      TEAM_TAG: "MoDo"
      SCHEDULE_URL: "https://stats.swehockey.se/ScheduleAndResults/Schedule/18266"
      THESPORTSDB_API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY"
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

---

## 🖥️ Using with Glance Dashboard

Here is a minimal Glance widget example:

```yaml
- type: custom-api
  title: Hockey – Matches
  cache: 30m
  url: http://hockey-api:8000/team
```

You can customize it with logos, score colors, etc.

---

## 🏗️ Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run locally:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Fetches Swehockey schedule HTML
2. Extracts text and splits it into logical lines
3. Parses:

   * Dates
   * Times
   * Teams
   * Results (if available)
   * Spectators
   * Venue
4. Filters by your `TEAM_TAG`
5. Computes last/next games
6. Fetches badges via TheSportsDB
7. Returns clean JSON suited for dashboards

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome!
Ideas for improvements include:

* better parser for irregular Swehockey formats
* multi-team support (`/team/{tag}`)
* caching layer
* tests
* logo provider fallbacks
* automatic schedule discovery
